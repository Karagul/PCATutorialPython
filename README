# PCA Tutorial, using Python

This is a notebook that can help you teach yourself how to do principal components analysis using Python.

As example data, the notebook uses extracellular neuron spike waveforms, recorded from a silicon recording electrode in mouse visual cortex.  Data is sampled at around 30 kHz.  Each waveform is a vector of length nTimepts (nTimepts is about 50, total waveform duration is about 1.5 ms).

PCA finds new vectors that give the directions in a vector space (in this case the space of dimension nTimepoints, in which each waveform is a single point) that maximize the variation of the data points, subject to orthogonality constraints.
